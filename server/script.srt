00:00:00:000 --> 00:00:05:000
An application programming interface API

2
00:00:05:000 --> 00:00:10:000
is a way for two

3
00:00:10:000 --> 00:00:15:000
or more computer programs or

4
00:00:15:000 --> 00:00:20:000
components to communicate with each

5
00:00:20:000 --> 00:00:25:000
other It is a type

6
00:00:25:000 --> 00:00:30:000
of software interface offering a

7
00:00:30:000 --> 00:00:35:000
service to other pieces of

8
00:00:35:000 --> 00:00:40:000
software 1 A document or

9
00:00:40:000 --> 00:00:45:000
standard that describes how to

10
00:00:45:000 --> 00:00:50:000
build or use such a

11
00:00:50:000 --> 00:00:55:000
connection or interface is called

12
00:00:55:000 --> 00:01:00:000
an API specification A computer

13
00:01:00:000 --> 00:01:05:000
system that meets this standard

14
00:01:05:000 --> 00:01:10:000
is said to implement or

15
00:01:10:000 --> 00:01:15:000
expose an API The term

16
00:01:15:000 --> 00:01:20:000
API may refer either to

17
00:01:20:000 --> 00:01:25:000
the specification or to the

18
00:01:25:000 --> 00:01:30:000
implementation Whereas a system s

19
00:01:30:000 --> 00:01:35:000
user interface dictates how its

20
00:01:35:000 --> 00:01:40:000
end users interact with the

21
00:01:40:000 --> 00:01:45:000
system in question its API

22
00:01:45:000 --> 00:01:50:000
dictates how to write code

23
00:01:50:000 --> 00:01:55:000
that takes advantage of that

24
00:01:55:000 --> 00:02:00:000
system s capabilities
